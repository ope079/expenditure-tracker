## **Brief**
The project brief is to design a CRUD application with "utilisation of all the supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training". It should meet the requirements set by my knaban board designed specifically for this project. The project should contain at least 2 tables as per the project spec, a functioning front end built using flask, full automated testing and integration into a version control system with testing carried out through a CI server and the project, and be deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.

### **Additional Requirements**
In addition to what has been set out in the brief, I am also required to provide:
